# ⚔️ Student RPG: Gamified Task Manager

> **Turn your daily life into a Role-Playing Game. Complete tasks, gain XP, and avoid losing HP.**

## 📖 About The Project

As a student, staying motivated to complete assignments and daily chores can be difficult. **Student RPG** solves this by applying game mechanics to real life. 

This web application allows users to input tasks as "Quests." 
- **Completing a quest** grants Experience Points (XP) and helps the user Level Up.
- **Giving up on a quest** deals damage to the user's Health Points (HP). 
- If HP reaches zero, it's **Game Over** (Level Reset).

It is built with a focus on pure logic implementation without external frameworks, ensuring high performance and understanding of core web technologies.
